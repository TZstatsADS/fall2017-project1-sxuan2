### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Project title: What topics do Republican and Democratic Presidents focus on?
+ This project is conducted by Sijian Xuan

+ Project summary: This project researchs on inaugurations of US presidents and focus on the difference of topics presidents talk about from both parties(Republican and Democratic), as well as some other interesting facts. From the topic modeling method we can actually see the two parties are representing the benefit of American people and government in general; they also have some specific topics that only they care about.
